## Description
Describe outputs of your program accurately, knowing what kind of data your program produces is critical.
Documentation can be quite technical, since it is not going to be facing end-users but other programmers.
### Shared memory interface with convoyer
TEXT
### Automatic (and manual) control
Goals for automatic control:
- Tries to maximize product output, while causing nothing to break
- Allows toggling manual overrides to any controls
- Simple internal logic using sensor data and user controlsÂ 

Changes made to control data according to automation:
- Conveyor target speed is OPTIMAL_SOC. currently if temperature is over 80, target speed is 0
- Heaters are on according to heater_period (20s on -> 10s off <-> 5s on)
- Cooler is on according to setted COOLING_TEMP (currently 60)
- heater_periods, OPTIMAL_SOC, COOLING_TEMP can be changed from automatic_controls.hpp

Manual control:
- If manual control is setted on. Simply keep the manual settings on and in those parts where there are no manual settings, continue with automatic.
